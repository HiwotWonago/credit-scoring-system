# Credit Scoring Business Understanding
Credit scoring plays a crucial role in evaluating the risk associated with lending or providing insurance to individuals or organizations. It enables businesses to:
- **Assess Creditworthiness**: Predict a customerâ€™s ability and likelihood to repay debt or honor financial commitments.
- **Support Risk-Based Pricing**: Align premiums or interest rates with the estimated risk.
- **Reduce Default and Fraud Risk**: Identify high-risk applicants early to minimize losses.
- **Comply with Regulations**: Ensure transparent, fair, and explainable credit decisioning.
In the context of this project, we aim to build a credit scoring system that uses historical insurance underwriting and claims data to predict risk and inform business decisions.
This involves exploring data, engineering features, and developing predictive models to optimize pricing and improve risk management.
