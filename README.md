# Credit Scoring Business Understanding
Credit scoring plays a crucial role in evaluating the risk associated with lending or providing insurance to individuals or organizations. It enables businesses to:
- **Assess Creditworthiness**: Predict a customer’s ability and likelihood to repay debt or honor financial commitments.
- **Support Risk-Based Pricing**: Align premiums or interest rates with the estimated risk.
- **Reduce Default and Fraud Risk**: Identify high-risk applicants early to minimize losses.
- **Comply with Regulations**: Ensure transparent, fair, and explainable credit decisioning.
Basel II is an international business standard that requires financial institutions to maintain enough cash reserves to cover risks incurred by their operations. The Basel accords are a series of recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Basel II Accord is built on three pillars: 
	minimum capital requirements, 
	supervisory review, and 
	Market discipline. 
These pillars work together to strengthen the stability and soundness of the international banking system.  Under the standardized approach, the amount that should be held as capital for every retail exposure, as a percentage of the total exposure is 75%.
The Basel II Accord regulatory framework emphasizes:
•	Transparency: Regulators require clear documentation of model logic to validate risk calculations.
•	Accountability: Interpretable models enable auditors and stakeholders to trace decision pathways, ensuring compliance.
•	Risk Sensitivity: Accurate risk differentiation (e.g., low vs. high-risk borrowers) directly impacts capital allocation.
Without interpretable models, institutions cannot justify risk assessments to regulators, risking non-compliance penalties and inadequate capital buffers.
2. Proxy Variables: Necessity and Risks
Why a proxy is needed:
Bank card transaction data lacks explicit "default" labels. A proxy (e.g., *90-day delinquency* or persistent non-payment) must be engineered to approximate default behavior for model training.
Business risks of proxy-based predictions:
•	Misalignment: The proxy may not fully capture true default (e.g., temporary delinquency vs. permanent insolvency), leading to inaccurate risk scores.
•	Bias Amplification: Proxies might overrepresent certain demographics (e.g., subprime borrowers), causing unfair lending practices.
•	Regulatory Scrutiny: Model validation becomes challenging if regulators question the proxy’s relevance, potentially rejecting the model.
•	Financial Loss: False negatives (approving high-risk clients) increase default rates; false positives (rejecting creditworthy clients) reduce revenue.
3. Model Trade-offs in Regulated Contexts
  |Simple Models (e.g., Logistic Regression with WoE)              | Complex Models (e.g., Gradient Boosting)|

                                                                     | with robust explainability frameworks.|
In the context of this project, we aim to build a credit scoring system that uses historical insurance underwriting and claims data to predict risk and inform business decisions.
This involves exploring data, engineering features, and developing predictive models to optimize pricing and improve risk management.
